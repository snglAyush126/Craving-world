# Craving-world (Under-Development)

## Overview  
Craving-World is a food ordering website that aims to connect users with a variety of restaurants and their delectable menus. Initially built using HTML and CSS for the frontend, the website is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience on various devices. Currently, the project is underway to integrate Node.js as the backend technology. The goal is to enhance functionality by adding user authentication (sign-in and sign-up) and eventually incorporating a database to store user information and order details.

## Front-end Features
Home Page: The landing page introduces users to the concept of the website, showcasing appealing food images and enticing call-to-action buttons.

Sign-In and Sign-Up Pages: Users can create an account (sign-up) or log in to an existing account (sign-in) to access additional features like order history and user preferences.

Order food Page: When users select a specific restaurant, they are directed to the restaurant's menu page, where they can view the available dishes, their descriptions, and prices.
